When you are selecting a primary volume for a mirrored pair, System Manager displays a list of all the eligible volumes for that mirrored pair. Any volumes that are not eligible to be used do not display in that list.

Volumes may not be eligible for any of the following reasons:

* The volume is a non-standard volume, such as a snapshot volume.
* The volume is not optimal.
* The volume is already participating in a mirroring relationship.
