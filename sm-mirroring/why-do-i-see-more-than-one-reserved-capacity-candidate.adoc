You see more than one reserved capacity candidate when System Manager detects more than one volume in a pool or volume group that meets the capacity percentage amount you selected for the storage object.

You can choose to refresh the list of recommended candidates by changing the percentage of physical drive space that you want to reserve on the base volume for copy service operations. System Manager displays the best reserved capacity candidates based on your selection.
