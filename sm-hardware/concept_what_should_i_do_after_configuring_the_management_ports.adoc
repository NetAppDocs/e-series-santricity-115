If you changed the IP address for the storage array, you might want to update the global array view in SANtricity Unified Manager.

To update the global array view in Unified Manager, open the interface and go to menu:Manage[Discover].

If you are also using the SANtricity Storage Manager for global array management, go to the Enterprise Management Window (EMW) and re-add the storage array to the EMW's list:

. Locate the array in the EMW's list of storage arrays.
. Remove the array from the list.
. Using the new IP address, re-add the storage array to the EMW's list.
