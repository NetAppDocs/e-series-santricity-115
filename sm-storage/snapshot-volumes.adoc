You can create a snapshot volume and assign it to a host if you want to read or write snapshot data. The snapshot volume shares the same characteristics as the base volume (RAID level, I/O characteristics, and so on).

When you create a snapshot volume, you can designate it as __read-onl__y or _read-write accessible_.

When you create read-only snapshot volumes, you do not need to add reserved capacity. When you create read-write snapshot volumes, you must add reserved capacity to provide write-access.
